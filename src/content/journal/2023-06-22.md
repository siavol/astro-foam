Today was an exciting day filled with coding challenges and breakthroughs. I made significant progress on a new project, and I can't wait to share my accomplishments.

## Task: Implementing a User Authentication System

```python
class User(models.Model):
    username = models.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True)
    password = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username
```

I started by creating the User model for our authentication system. It includes fields for the username, password, and email. The `__str__` method will display the username when the User object is printed.

### User Registration View

```python
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.contrib.auth.hashers import make_password
from django.views import View
from django.http import JsonResponse

class UserRegistrationView(View):
    def post(self, request):
        username = request.POST.get('username')
        password = request.POST.get('password')
        email = request.POST.get('email')

        User = get_user_model()
        new_user = User(username=username, password=make_password(password), email=email)
        new_user.save()

        return JsonResponse({'message': 'User registered successfully!'})
```

In the UserRegistrationView, I implemented the logic for user registration. It receives a POST request with the username, password, and email. The view retrieves the User model dynamically using `get_user_model()` to support custom user models. Then, it creates a new user with the provided information, encrypts the password using `make_password()`, and saves the user to the database. Finally, a JSON response is returned indicating the successful registration.
