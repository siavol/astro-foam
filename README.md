# Astro-Foam

AstroFoam is an experimental project that combines the power of
[Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam)
to provide a seamless web application for navigating, viewing, and searching the Foam knowledge database.

## Getting Started

1. Create symlinks to your foam:
    ```sh
    ln -s <your-foam>/journal ./foam/journal
    ```
2. Run _Astro-Foam_
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
