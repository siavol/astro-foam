# Astro-Foam

Astro-Foam is an experimental project that combines the power of
[Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam)
to provide a seamless web application for navigating, viewing, and searching the Foam knowledge database.

## Getting Started

1. Copy your foam content:
    ```sh
    $ cp -R <your-foam>/journal ./src/content/journal
    $ cp -R <your-foam>/books ./src/content/books
    ```
2. Run _Astro-Foam_
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
